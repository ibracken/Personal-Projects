## KnightTour

Java algorithm to calculate a series of moves to get a knight around a chessboard without repeating any squares. Involves optimization to reduce runtime, successfully working for boards larger than traditional chessboards. The most successful approach uses recursion and a look-ahead strategy to determine the future move options.
