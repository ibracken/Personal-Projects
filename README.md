## NBA Prediction Model:

This project is a machine learning model designed to predict NBA player fantasy points using a random forest regression algorithm. The model is built with Python and leverages Selenium for web scraping, PostgreSQL for data storage, and Python for data processing and sklearn for model training.

With its advanced predictive capabilities, the model outperforms DraftKings projections 48% of the time, showcasing its strong accuracy and potential for real-world applications.

## Secure Double Ratchet Messaging Service
This project implements a secure messaging platform using the Double Ratchet encryption algorithm, providing strong end-to-end encryption with perfect forward secrecy and post-compromise security. The system features certificate-based authentication, secure message exchange between multiple users, and a server-based abuse reporting mechanism that preserves user privacy. Built with Python using the cryptography library, it demonstrates advanced cryptographic concepts including ECDH key exchange, AES-GCM encryption, and El-Gamal encryption for secure reporting. The implementation ensures messages remain secure even if past keys are compromised.

## CSXL Site To-Do List:

In this project, another student and I built a To-Do List for the CSXL, the community hub of the UNC Computer Science Department, which sees thousands of users per month.
This project, which is built with Angular, FastAPI, PostgreSQL and TypeScript, can be found [here](https://github.com/comp423-24f/ex04-todo-api-ex04-05).

## Simple Blockchain in Go

This project demonstrates the basic principles of a blockchain, implemented in Go. It includes block creation, proof-of-work mining, and persistent storage with BoltDB. Link to repository is [here](https://github.com/ibracken/Simple-Blockchain).

## Basic Instagram

Built with Next.js, a React framework. Uses Supabase to store user information and posts. Very minimal styling and features beyond the basic concept.

## gymTracker

Also built with Next.js. Based on the Basic Instagram concept but significantly more advanced. The website allows users to input workouts, featuring user authentication, styling, and interactive components. It uses dynamic routing and foreign key relations to store and display user information related to their workouts. Link to repository is [here](https://github.com/ibracken/gymTracker). Mobile version built using React Native can be found [here](https://github.com/ibracken/GymTrackerMobile).

## KnightTour

Java algorithm to calculate a series of moves to get a knight around a chessboard without repeating any squares. Involves optimization to reduce runtime, successfully working for boards larger than traditional chessboards. The most successful approach uses recursion and a look-ahead strategy to determine the future move options.
