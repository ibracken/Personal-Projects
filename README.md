Welcome to my Personal Projects! Below you will find brief descriptions of these projects I've been working on.

Basic Instagram: Built with Next.js, a react framework. Uses databases with Supabase to store user info and posts. Very minimal styling and features beyond the basic concept.

gymtrackerrr: Also built with Next.js. This takes form the Basic Instagram concept but is used to input workouts and is significantly more advanced. The website has user authentication styling, and interactive components. Uses dynamic routing and foreign key relations to store and display user info relating to their workouts.

KnightTour: Java algorithm to calculate a series of moves to get a knight around a chessboard without repeating any squares. Took a fair amount of optimization and adjustments to reduce runtime but ultimately works for boards way larger than traditional chessboards. The most successful approach I used involved recursion and looking ahead to see which squares had more possible moves in the future.

Portfolio Website: One of my first Next.js projects. This is a simple static website

WebScraping: Simple web scraping algorithms using python and the BeautifulSoup and pandas libraries
